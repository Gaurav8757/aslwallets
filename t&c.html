                        the Parties will negotiate in good faith to agree on one or more provisions to be substituted
                        therefor, which provisions shall, as nearly as practicable, leave the Parties in the same or
                        nearly similar position to that which prevailed prior to such invalidity, illegality or
                        unenforceability. Such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
                        provisions of these Terms and Conditions, and these Terms and Conditions shall be construed as
                        if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained in these Terms and
                        Conditions, and the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions shall be given full force
                        and effect.<br /><br />

                        shall be valid unless in writing and properly executed by ASL WALLETS.<br /><br />

                        11.14 Waiver: A waiver by ASL WALLETS in respect of a breach of a provision of these Terms and
                        Conditions by the Retailer/Distributor/Super Distributor will not be deemed to be a waiver in
                        respect of any other breach and the failure of ASL WALLETS to enforce at any time a provision of
                        these Terms and Conditions will in no way be interpreted as a waiver of such
                        provision.<br /><br />

                        11.15 Third Parties: Nothing in these Terms and Conditions, unless expressly provided for
                        herein, is intended to confer upon any person, other than the Parties hereto and their permitted

                        Terms and Conditions shall prevent any further or other exercise thereof or the exercise of any
